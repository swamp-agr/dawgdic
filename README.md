### How to reproduce:

- Install `bench-show`:

```
cabal install bench-show --overwrite-policy=always
```

- Run and wait (it might take around `1h` to complete):

```
time cabal bench +RTS "-N4 -A64m -n4m -qb0" -RTS  --benchmark-options="--output bench.html --csv results.csv"
```

- Generate report:

```
bench-show --presentation=Solo report results.csv
```

## Contributing

In cases of issues please attach callstack, provide minimal dictionary lexicon and provide logs with enabled tracing.

```
