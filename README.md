# dawgdic

## Overview

**dawgdic** is a library for building and accessing 
dictionaries implemented with directed acyclic word 
graphs (DAWG).

This is a ported version of [C++ dawgdic library](https://github.com/s-yata/dawgdic).

## Features

This library offers `DAWG`, `Dictionary`, `Guide` and `Completer` data types as well as their builders.

## Installation

Add following snippet to your `cabal.project`.

```
source-repository-package
  type: git
  location: https://github.com/swamp-agr/dawgdic.git
  tag: <commit>
```

Add `dawgdic` dependency to your project and run `cabal build`.

### How to reproduce:

- Install `bench-show`:

```
cabal install bench-show --overwrite-policy=always
```

- Run and wait (it might take around `1h` to complete):

```
time cabal bench +RTS "-N4 -A64m -n4m -qb0" -RTS  --benchmark-options="--output bench.html --csv results.csv"
```

- Generate report:

```
bench-show --presentation=Solo report results.csv
```

## Contributing

In cases of issues please attach callstack, provide minimal dictionary lexicon and provide logs with enabled tracing.

```
cabal build -ftrace
```
